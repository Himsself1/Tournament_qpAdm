* Tournament Approach for qpAdm

This script provides a tournamnet approach for qpAdm inference for a set
of competing populations as described in Lazaridis et al., 2025
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08531-5)

Positive values indicate that the population on *x-axis* is better.
Negative values indicate that the population on *y-axis* is better.
